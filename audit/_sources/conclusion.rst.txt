Conclusion
==========

After in-depth reading through the *ODEM* smart contract project code,
intensive conversations with the customers and developers about the goals
and the actual implementation of this project, extensive testing and
attendance of source code corrections, no issues were found that would
hinder the *ODEM* Crowdsale from being deployed on the Ethereum main network
and thus going productive.
