Introduction
============

The *ODEM* Crowdsale is an ICO based on `Ethereum`_ smart contracts written
in the `Solidity`_ programming language, starting in the middle of February
2018.

Prior to deploying this project onto the Ethereum main network, extensive
code tests and several code audits were performed on the involved smart
contracts.

This document is a report of one of those audits and subdivided into three
main parts.

#.  The first part describes the overall structure of the *ODEM* contracts
    a gives a detailed description of the functionality, features and
    lifecycle of the single contracts.

#.  The second part contains the code review.
    It contains the findings after intensive reading of the projects
    source codes, comments on the coding style and thoughts about the
    vulnerability to some known attacks.

#.  The third part is about testing -- which test cases were identified,
    how the tests were carried out.

.. note::

   **Disclaimer**

   This audit is not a legally binding document and it doesn’t guarantee
   anything.

   Nevertheless it is a result of careful work done for the best.

   That it’s just a discussion document.
